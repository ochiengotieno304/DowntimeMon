    <p class="mb-4">Timely is web downtime monitoring tool that checks your website periodically to see if it's
      available and
      functioning properly. If the website is down or experiencing issues, Timely alerts you so you can take
      action.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why is it important to monitor website downtime?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Monitoring website downtime is important because it allows you to quickly identify and resolve
      issues with your website.
      If your website is down or not functioning properly, it can impact your users' experience and lead to lost revenue
      or
      other negative outcomes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How often should I check my website for downtime?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">The frequency with which you should check your website for downtime depends on your specific needs
      and circumstances.
      Some businesses may choose to check their website every few minutes, while others may check less frequently.
      Generally,
      it's a good idea to check your website at regular intervals, such as every 5 or 10 minutes. Timely provides a
      range of time selections during service registration.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Timely will alert you via email, or SMS<i class="text-gray-700">(implementing)</i> if it
      detects that your website
      is down or experiencing issues. You can set up your preferred notification methods and customize the alert<i class="text-gray-700">(in future updates)</i>
      settings to
      suit your needs.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What should I do if I receive an alert that my website is down?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">If you receive an alert that your website is down or experiencing issues, you should investigate the
      issue to determine
      the cause and take action to resolve it. Depending on the issue, you may need to contact your hosting provider or
      web
      developer for assistance.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Can I use this website downtime monitor for multiple websites?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Yes, Timely allows you to monitor multiple websites from a single dashboard.
      You can add or
      remove websites from your account and customize the monitoring settings for each site.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How accurate is the website downtime monitor?</h3>
    The website downtime monitor is designed to be as accurate as possible, but there may be instances where false
    positives
    or false negatives occur. Factors such as network latency or intermittent connectivity issues can impact the
    accuracy of
    the tool.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Are there any limitations to the website downtime monitor?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">The website downtime monitor can only check your website from the outside, so it may not be able to
      detect issues that
      are specific to your internal infrastructure. Additionally, if your website is hosted on a platform that doesn't
      allow
      external monitoring, the website downtime monitor may not be able to check your website</p>
